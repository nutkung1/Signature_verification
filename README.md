I made this to Studied which algorithm is more appropriate for this project between Support vector machine (SVM) and Artificial neural network (ANN). Furthermore, the better algorithm is ANN because it provides better accuracy at 95 percent, but SVM has about 90 percent accuracy, accordingly we use the ANN algorithm to give us the precise result.
